<!--
Main goal:
  Create html page that looks like telegram instant view page
About instant view:
  instantview.telegram.org
Examples:
  telegra.ph/api
  telegra.ph/europa-04-19

Assumptions about page structure:
  tl_page_wrap - centering, restrict width
    tl_page - add padding: top, bottom
      tl_article - container, not add padding
        tl_article_header - header of the article
        tl_editor - another layer
          gl-editor - contains html elements, imgs, pragraph etc.
          ... - hide
        tl_article_buttons - hide for not author (edit and publish buttons)

Notes:
  don't use class names same as html tags, firefox inspect elements will
not show that css property.

          <p>
            <strong> Jupiter </strong> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
            Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth
            that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other
            planets in the Solar System combined.
          </p>

          <h4>Physical characteristics</h4>
          <p>
            Jupiter is composed primarily of gaseous and liquid matter.
            It is the largest of the four giant planets in the Solar System
            and hence its largest planet. It has a diameter of 142,984 km
            (88,846 mi) at its equator. The average density of Jupiter,
             1.326 g/cm3, is the second highest of the giant planets,
             but lower than those of the four terrestrial planets.
          </p>

          <h4>Radiotelescope research</h4>
          <p>
            Scientists discovered that there were three forms of radio signals transmitted from Jupiter.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of meters)
              vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are influenced by interaction
              of Io with Jupiter's magnetic field.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured in centimeters)
              was first observed by Frank Drake and Hein Hvatum in 1959.
              The origin of this signal was from a torus-shaped belt around
              Jupiter's equator. This signal is caused by
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation">cyclotron radiation</a>
              from electrons that are accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere of Jupiter.
            </li>
          </ul>
